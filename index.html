	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Arcana Lab at Northwestern University, advised by Prof. Simone Campanoni.
		I am primarily interested in new abstractions and representations in Compilers and Computer Architecture.
		Before Northwestern I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
	</p>
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<h3>Developing Parallel Computation Architectures</h3>
	<p>Senior design project focusing on accelerating biologically-accurate neuron simulation using the Hodgkin-Huxley model.
		Designed and implemented an algorithm for partitioning the work for multi-neuron simulation across several machines.
		Designed an algorithm to run a simulation using the Hodgkin-Huxley model on the GPU using NVIDIA CUDA.
